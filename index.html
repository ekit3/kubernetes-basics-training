                orchestrator concepts
                ---
                ## What is a container?
                It's all about isolation

                * process
                * cpu & memory
                * users
                * network
                * storage (filesystem)
                * devices

                ---
                ## What is a container?
                Isolation enables cohabitation

                ## Docker - Write Once, Run anywhere ☕
                ![](images//02-write-once-run-anywhere.png)

                ---
                ## How to run containers in a cluster environment ?
                ![](images//03-hosts.png)

                ---
                ## Problems Docker doesn't solve

                * how to manage multiple updates, tons of containers, on multiple hosts
                * how to choose which server will host which container
                * what if a host is down
                * how to scale (up/down)
                * how to manage container lifecycle (restarts)

                ---
                ## container orchestration

                ![](images//04-orchestration.png)

                ---
                ## What an orchestrator does

                * Manages containers lifecycle
                * Ensures high availability
                * Load balances traffic
                * Provides service discovery
                * Provides network as an overlay between hosts
                * Provides grouping of resources
                * Stores configuration
                * Stores secrets
                * Scales up/down containers
                * Provides storage (persistent & distributed)
                * Implements Role-based access control

                ---
                ## Introducing Kubernetes
                * Open-Source project
                * Initiated by Google in 2014
                * Based on 15 years of experience by Google (Borg project)
                * Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF graduated project)
                * Two nicknames:
                  * kube
                  * k8s

                ## Kubernetes architecture
                ![](images//06-kubernetes-architecture.png)

                ---
                # Kubernetes main concepts

                ---
                ## Pod

                > Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

                ![](images//07-pod.png)

                ---
                ## Pod

                * a Pod is a group of one or more containers
                * containers in a Pod share storage and network resources
                * they can communication through loopback (localhost)
                * a Pod has an IP address in the cluster
                * resources of a Pod are co-located
                * generally, Pods contains only one container

                ---
                ## workloads : deployments & replicasets

                > Deployments manages a replicated application on your cluster
                >
                > ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of Pod replicas are running at one time

                ![](images//08-deployment.png)

                ---
                ## workloads : deployments & replicasets

                * a Deployment helps to define & update a ReplicaSet
                * a ReplicaSet holds the definition of a Pod, which should be replicated to one or multiple instances (replicas)
                * provides guarantee of the specified number of identical running Pods
                * Pods are scheduled by the controllers on any available node
                * the controller ensures that the correct number of Pods are always running
                * Deployment enables the updates of Pods using rolling updates

                ---
                ## workloads : daemonset

                > DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod.

                ![](images//09-daemonset.png)

                ---
                ## workloads : daemonset

                typical use cases:
                * logs management
                * monitoring
                * cluster storage

                ---
                ## workloads : jobs/cronjobs

                > Job creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate.
                > Cronjobs creates Jobs on a repeating schedule.

                ![](images//10-cronjob.png)

                ---
                ## workloads : jobs/cronjobs

                * a Job runs a Pod until completion
                * if the Pod is failed, killed or deleted, the Job will be restarted
                * use case: one-time running batch
                * a Cronjob uses crontab syntax to define schedules
                * use case: batches !

                ---
                ## networking: services

                > A Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.

                ![](images//11-services.png)

                ---
                ## networking: services

                * a Service is an internal IP and single DNS name for a set of Pods
                * It provides load-balancing between Pods
                * The set of Pods is targeted using selectors (a set of labels)
                * This mecanism replaces service-discovery & VIPs
                * A Service listens on a port, and redirects traffic to a port in the Pods
                * A Service is visible inside the cluster

                ---
                ## networking: ingress

                > Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to Services within the cluster

                ![](images//12-ingress.png)

                ---
                ## networking: ingress

                * Ingress gives Services externally-reachable URLs
                * It can provide SSL/TLS termination
                * Name-based virtual hosting
                * Runs on Layer 7 (HTTP)
                * Uses the "Host" HTTP Header to route requests to the right Service
                * An Ingress Controllers manages Ingress, such a Traefik or Nginx
